# Jeremy's SuperCC fork — notes

A personal fork of **[SicklySilverMoon/SuperCC](https://github.com/SicklySilverMoon/SuperCC)**
(the Chip's Challenge / Tile World TASing emulator), with a few display-only mods and a
self-contained build. Upstream is GPLv2+; see `COPYING`.

## What's changed vs upstream

Each mod is its own commit on top of the pristine import, so `git log`/`git diff` show exactly
what's mine. All mods are **display-only** — no gameplay/solution/RNG behavior changes (verified: a
headless replay of a known solution reproduces the exact same tick-by-tick result before and after).

1. **Window title = build tag + pack + current level** (`java/emulator/SuperCC.java`).
   Title reads `SuperCC [jc-1] - <pack> - <level>` (bump the `[jc-N]` tag per production deploy so the
   running build is identifiable). Upstream showed only the level name; an earlier mod showed only the
   pack — this shows the version, pack, and current level together, updating as you change levels.
2. **Hint shown in the level panel** (`java/graphics/LevelPanel.java`). The level's hint text is drawn
   under "Author:" (uncapped width so even the longest hint wraps fully); hidden on hintless levels.
3. **Clone/Trap connections on by default** (`java/graphics/MenuBar.java`, `java/graphics/GamePanel.java`).
   The Clone- and Trap-connection overlays render by default (matching Monster/Slip list), and the
   "Show Clone Connections" menu label casing is fixed.

## Building

Requires a **JDK 16+** (upstream targets Java 16). From this folder:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1     # -> SuperCC.jar
```

`build.ps1` recompiles **only the hand-edited, non-form source files** (listed in `$MODIFIED`) with
`javac --release 16` and splices them over the committed baseline of compiled classes, then repackages
with the libs (`com/intellij` annotations, `org/json`), `resources/`, and the manifest — reproducing
the upstream fat jar (571 entries, 193 classes). It resolves a real JDK bin automatically (the Oracle
`javapath` dir on PATH exposes `javac` but not `jar`).

**Why not a full `javac` rebuild?** SuperCC's GUI is built with the IntelliJ GUI Designer — the main
`graphics/Gui` window and the `tools/*` dialogs each have a `.form` file, and IntelliJ's *form compiler*
generates a hidden `$$$setupUI$$$()` method at build time that creates their Swing components. Plain
`javac` doesn't do that, so a full rebuild yields a jar whose GUI dies on launch (`... playButton is
null`). So the IntelliJ-built `.class` files are committed as the authoritative baseline (under
`emulator/ game/ graphics/ io/ tools/ util/`), and only the non-form modified classes are recompiled.
**Adding a mod to a new file?** Add it to `$MODIFIED` in `build.ps1` — and make sure it has no sibling
`.form`.

## Note on history / source vs. bytecode

Upstream ships its `.java` source *inside* the jar under `java/`. The prior hand-built mods were
spliced in as recompiled `.class` files only — the bundled source stayed pristine. This repo
reconstructs the mods **into the source** (from the documented changes) so the source is authoritative
for the non-form classes, while the IntelliJ-built `.class` baseline is committed for the form classes
that `javac` can't reproduce (see the build note above).
