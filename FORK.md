# Jeremy's SuperCC fork — notes

A personal fork of **[SicklySilverMoon/SuperCC](https://github.com/SicklySilverMoon/SuperCC)**
(the Chip's Challenge / Tile World TASing emulator), with a few display-only mods and a
self-contained build. Upstream is GPLv2+; see `COPYING`.

## What's changed vs upstream

Each mod is its own commit on top of the pristine import, so `git log`/`git diff` show exactly
what's mine. All mods are **display-only** — no gameplay/solution/RNG behavior changes (verified: a
headless replay of a known solution reproduces the exact same tick-by-tick result before and after).

1. **Window title = build tag + pack + current level** (`java/emulator/SuperCC.java`).
   Title reads `SuperCC [jc-N] - <pack> - <level>` (bump `BUILD_TAG` per production deploy so the
   running build is identifiable). Upstream showed only the level name; an earlier mod showed only the
   pack — this shows the version, pack, and current level together, updating as you change levels.
   **The `[jc-N]` half is toggleable — see below.**
2. **Hint shown in the level panel** (`java/graphics/LevelPanel.java`). The level's hint text is drawn
   under "Author:" (uncapped width so even the longest hint wraps fully); hidden on hintless levels.
3. **Clone/Trap connections on by default** (`java/graphics/MenuBar.java`, `java/graphics/GamePanel.java`).
   The Clone- and Trap-connection overlays render by default (matching Monster/Slip list), and the
   "Show Clone Connections" menu label casing is fixed.

## Toggling the build tag (no rebuild)

The tag is handy while the fork is under active modification and just noise the rest of the time,
so it is switched by a setting rather than by a rebuild. In the CC folder's `settings.ini`:

```ini
[Graphics]
ShowBuildTag = false
```

`true` shows the tag, `false` (or `0`) hides it, and the key being **absent means ON** — anything
other than `false`/`0` counts as on, so a typo or a `settings.ini` predating the key keeps the tag
rather than silently dropping it. Settings are parsed once at launch, so a change applies the
**next time SuperCC starts**.

> **Don't put a trailing `;` comment on that line.** `parseSettings()` only honors a `;` at the
> *start* of a line; everything after `=` is the value. `ShowBuildTag = false ; hides it` yields the
> value `false ; hides it`, which is not `false`, so the tag stays **on**.

Three more ways to get this wrong by hand:

- **The space before `=` is load-bearing.** `parseSettings()` reads the key as
  `substring(0, indexOf('=') - 1)`, so `ShowBuildTag=false` parses as the key `ShowBuildTa` and is
  ignored — leaving the tag on.
- **The section matters.** Keys are stored as `<section>:<name>`, so a `ShowBuildTag` line under
  `[Paths]` is a different key that nothing ever reads. It must be inside `[Graphics]`.
- **Don't edit while SuperCC is running.** It keeps the whole settings file in memory and rewrites
  every line of it whenever any setting changes, so a running instance restores its own stale value
  over the edit.

`set_supercc_buildtag.ps1` (in Jeremy's `Dropbox\Claude\CC Audit Scripts\`) mirrors the parser on all
three: it scopes to `[Graphics]`, reports the state SuperCC would actually see (so a no-space line
reads as *on*, and gets repaired rather than reported as working), takes the last of any duplicates,
writes atomically via a temp file, and verifies by reading back.

Switching the tag off does **not** make a build unidentifiable — `BUILD_TAG` is still a string
constant in the jar, so `unzip`/`javap` on `emulator/SuperCC.class` still names the release.

## Building

Requires a **JDK 16+** (upstream targets Java 16). From this folder:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1     # -> SuperCC.jar
```

`build.ps1` recompiles **only the hand-edited, non-form source files** (listed in `$MODIFIED`) with
`javac --release 16` and splices them over the committed baseline of compiled classes, then repackages
with the libs (`com/intellij` annotations, `org/json`), `resources/`, and the manifest — reproducing
the upstream fat jar (571 entries, 193 classes). It resolves a real JDK bin automatically (the Oracle
`javapath` dir on PATH exposes `javac` but not `jar`).

**Why not a full `javac` rebuild?** SuperCC's GUI is built with the IntelliJ GUI Designer — the main
`graphics/Gui` window and the `tools/*` dialogs each have a `.form` file, and IntelliJ's *form compiler*
generates a hidden `$$$setupUI$$$()` method at build time that creates their Swing components. Plain
`javac` doesn't do that, so a full rebuild yields a jar whose GUI dies on launch (`... playButton is
null`). So the IntelliJ-built `.class` files are committed as the authoritative baseline (under
`emulator/ game/ graphics/ io/ tools/ util/`), and only the non-form modified classes are recompiled.
**Adding a mod to a new file?** Add it to `$MODIFIED` in `build.ps1` — and make sure it has no sibling
`.form`.

## Note on history / source vs. bytecode

Upstream ships its `.java` source *inside* the jar under `java/`. The prior hand-built mods were
spliced in as recompiled `.class` files only — the bundled source stayed pristine. This repo
reconstructs the mods **into the source** (from the documented changes) so the source is authoritative
for the non-form classes, while the IntelliJ-built `.class` baseline is committed for the form classes
that `javac` can't reproduce (see the build note above).
